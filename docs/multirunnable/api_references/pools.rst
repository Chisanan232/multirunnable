Pools Modules
==============

Pool modules means a pool of runnable objects like Process (Parallel),
Thread (Concurrent), Green Thread (Coroutine) or Task (Asynchronous).
It would run as the runnable you set with option *mode* (:doc:`./mode`).


Pool
=======

*module* multirunnable.pool

*class* multirunnable.pool.\ **Pool**

    An abstracted class which implement mostly all methods. The left one abstract
    method *_initial_running_strategy* is generating running strategy with option *mode*.

    About **Pool** object in *MultiRunnable*, it's an adapter which dispatches APIs to use
    APIs of one specific running strategy. It encapsulates about which running strategy you need to instantiate to use.
    Developers only needs to set the *RunningMode* to let it instantiates target running strategy by itself,
    so developers could focus on the usages of *Pool* but doesn't care about running strategy instantiating.

    Therefore, all the APIs is the same as *PoolRunnableStrategy*.

    AboutÔ∏è option *mode* and *executors*, it has been deprecated in version 0.17.0.


SimplePool
============

*module* multirunnable.pool

*class* multirunnable.pool.\ **SimplePool**

    An *Pool* object which could build parallelism as Parallel, Concurrent or Coroutine via option *mode*.

    Parameters:
        * *mode* (Optional[RunningMode]) : Which *RunningMode* choice to use.
        * *pool_size* (int) : The size of pool which would preprocessing about initialing :ref:`workers <MultiRunnable Worker Concept>`.
    Return:
        **Pool** object.


    **_initial_running_strategy**\ *()*

        Initial running strategy object which executor uses. The running strategy be
        controlled by option *mode*.

        Return:
            None.


AdapterPool
============

*module* multirunnable.pool

*class* multirunnable.pool.\ **AdapterPool**

    An *Pool* object which could build parallelism with customized features as Parallel, Concurrent or Coroutine via option *strategy*.

    Parameters:
        * *strategy* (Union[PoolRunnableStrategy, Resultable]) : The customized running strategy object which be extends *multirunnable.framework.runnable.PoolRunnableStrategy* and implements all methods.
    Return:
        **Pool** object.


    **_initial_running_strategy**\ *()*

        Initial running strategy object which executor uses. It would annotate the global
        variable *Pool_Runnable_Strategy* with the strategy object it gets from parameter
        *strategy*.

        Return:
            None.
